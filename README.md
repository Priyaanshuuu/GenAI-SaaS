GenAI Multi Modal Summarizer

A full-stack SaaS application for generating summaries from PDFs, videos, audio files, images, and URLs. The platform is built to handle different media types in one place, with support for translations, audio summaries, exports, and sharing.

This project is focused on building a practical, production-ready GenAI product rather than a simple demo.
